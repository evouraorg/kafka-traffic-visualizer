1. Modify the producer time to use real time with millis:
        Reliable Timing Strategies
        1. Millisecond Timing (millis())

        javascript
        let lastEvent = 0;

        function draw() {
          if (millis() - lastEvent > 1000) { // Trigger every 1000ms
            doSomething();
            lastEvent = millis();
          }
        }
        Uses actual system clock time rather than frames15

        2. Delta Time Compensation

        javascript
        let posX = 0;
        let prevTime = 0;

        function draw() {
          const deltaTime = millis() - prevTime;
          posX += (100 * deltaTime)/1000; // 100px/second
          prevTime = millis();
        }
        Makes movement speed consistent regardless of FPS5

 2. Records shouldn't move faster if they're small. Replace this speed with "network" speed
   // Smaller records move slightly faster for visual variety
   const adjustedSpeed = baseSpeed * (1 - (radius - MIN_RECORD_RADIUS) / (MAX_RECORD_RADIUS - MIN_RECORD_RADIUS) * 0.3);


 3. Decouple record x line 833 from the object itself, it's an animation concern

 4. could we emit an event on record pushed to partition? line 847
   // Add the record to the partition
   partitions[partitionId].records.push(record);

   // Emit record produced event
   eventEmitter.emit(EVENTS.RECORD_PRODUCED, record);

 5. Make the emit record look more like a kafka producer

6. consumerThroughputMaxInBytes and processingCApacitySlider should be the same

7. partition algorithms configurable, instead of only modulo
